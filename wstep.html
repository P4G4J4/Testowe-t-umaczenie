<p>I never thought I'd write a book about burnout because I never thought I'd burnout.
I thought I had enough passion and determination to last me forever. 
However, after years of complex trauma, prison and repression coupled with intense workaholism, my body said no. 
I was hospitalized in February 2016 and it's taken me over two years to recover from acute and chronic rib pain.
I started to blog about my recovery.
I wanted to explore burnout, chronic illness and trauma through an anarchist lens.
From exploring how 'patriarchy makes me tied' to discussions on class, collective organizing and how state violence shapes your body.
I knew when I was recovering that I didn't want to abandon struggles for liberation and so I made an effort, with others, to reflect on and to change conditions in our collectives that contributed to people burning out and that led to better collective care and mutual aid. </p>

<li>Since writing the blogs, hundreds of people have contacted me and I've been blown away both by the support of strangers and also the sheer prevalence of burnout, physical and mental health issues, macho and oppressive attitudes to health and a loneliness in people's struggles with these experiences.</li>
